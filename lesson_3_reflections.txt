local?

    When working on a team, rather than independently.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

use one instead of another?

    Fork - a copy of a git repository on GitHub

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Work with up-to-date code offline

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
